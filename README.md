## Project Description

This project is an interactive **Football Team Cards Viewer** that allows users to explore player details and filter teammates dynamically using modern JavaScript techniques. It is built with a combination of **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** to provide a responsive and visually appealing interface.

The application displays player cards for the legendary **1986 Argentina World Cup-winning football team**. Users can filter the displayed players by position (Forward, Midfielder, Defender, Goalkeeper) or by those who have a nickname. The project showcases the use of **ES6+ JavaScript features**, DOM manipulation, event handling, and object immutability through `Object.freeze()`.

### Key Features

- Display team metadata such as team name, sport, year, and head coach.
- Render player cards dynamically from a structured JavaScript object.
- Implement filtering functionality using a dropdown menu.
- Utilize **modern JavaScript methods** like array `.map()`, `.filter()`, destructuring, and template literals.
- Responsive layout with **CSS Flexbox** and media queries for mobile-friendly display.
